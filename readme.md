Insert a pivot table into `App.js`:

```bash
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <FlexmonsterReact.Pivot toolbar={true} 
        componentFolder="https://cdn.flexmonster.com/" width="100%" 
        report="https://cdn.flexmonster.com/reports/report.json"/>
      </div>
